Hello folks, 

Currently founder of a marketing automation company and student in different discipline. Forgive my ignorance in the field, I'm the coding equivalent of the premature birth.

Learning computational theory (no real syntax currently, ironic username) because...
- Computers are a hugely fascinating, somewhat limitless endevour which cannot be found in other technical fields
- Learning technical subjects is edifying for the brain, keeps it sharp and fights entropy
- I will inevitably found something technological in the future. If I have fluency in some languages I will be able to create some back end systems (applications?) in a matter of days(?) to fulfil a specific business need.
  Also I'd want to know the basics of what my devs are doing
- Software has huge leverage and virtually 0 marginal cost of reproduction
- I find it extremely cool to be able to produce some mechanistic output (procedure)

Initially, I will only post exercises and experimentations from the Structure and Interpretations of Computer Programs, thus all code will be Scheme (dialect of LISP). Sorry. Later will include any projects I find fun. 

The completion of the book may take a while as I am completing this at a super leisurely pace, thus soaking up computational fundamentals and also keeping that passion burning bright in the abscence of any stingent deadlines.
